{"name":"Quirky","tagline":"Quirky IRC Client","body":"Quirky IRC Client\r\n===============\r\n\r\nDestined to be a *real* IRC client for both light and heavyweight\r\nIRC users.\r\nWe do plan on supporting all IRCv3 extensions, and already have\r\nminimal internal implementations under way.\r\n\r\nIn short: Wanted a good looking IRC client that was still an IRC client,\r\ndidn't have a shed-load of deps, and wasn't another IM library frontend. [1]\r\n\r\nCurrently under heavy development!\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n--------\r\nThe core library is missing a ton of checks, so wil likely crash in some\r\nsituations.  ircfuzz kills it instantly.  Also note there is NO SSL validation\r\nand all certificates are accepted!\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n------\r\n\r\nGPLv2\r\n\r\nVersioning\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSimple incremental version bumps, similar to other Evolve OS projects such as\r\nBudgie, i.e. v1, v2, v3. Version number is not an indicator of stability or\r\nfeature parity.\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n-------\r\n * Ikey Doherty <ikey@evolve-os.com>\r\n\r\n[1] They are CHANNELS. Not ROOMS.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
