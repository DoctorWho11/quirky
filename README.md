Quirky IRC Client
===============

Destined to be a *real* IRC client for both light and heavyweight
IRC users.
We do plan on supporting all IRCv3 extensions, and already have
minimal internal implementations under way.

In short: Wanted a good looking IRC client that was still an IRC client,
didn't have a shed-load of deps, and wasn't another IM library frontend. [1]

Currently under heavy development!

TODO
-----

 * Lots.
 * Replace queue scheduling with throttled independent queues
 * Ensure that works on Windows too.
 * Get a distributable Windows build out


Versioning
---------

Simple incremental version bumps, similar to other Solus projects such as
Budgie, i.e. v1, v2, v3. Version number is not an indicator of stability or
feature parity.
